## Requirements

*TO DO SH FILE*

## Project Setup with VSCode

This project already contains a .vscode folder containing the recommended extensions and their configurations and so this is the preferred editor to view/use and run this project.

After cloning the repo open the main folder of this project and vscode will prompt you to install the necessary extensions if you don't have all of them already.
